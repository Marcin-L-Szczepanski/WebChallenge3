## BEM

[BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info) has been used in this project.

Naming convention follows [Harry Roberts' naming convention](https://en.bem.info/toolbox/sdk/bem-naming/#harry-roberts-naming-convention).
Read more in the [Guidelines](https://cssguidelin.es/#bem-like-naming).

Two types of modifiers are used:
 - a boolean flag
 - a key/value pair
 
  * Boolean modifiers:<br>
    Original block/element name + double dash + mod name<br>
    **.b-block--mod** or **.b-block__elem--mod**
  * Key/value modifiers:<br>
    Original block/element name + double dash + mod key name + single underscore + mod value<br>
    **.b-block--key_value** or **.b-block__elem--key_value**
For example:
```html
  <button class="button button--secondary">...</button>
  <section class="l-section l-section--background_light">...</section>
```

A descendant selector can be used to modify an Element based on a Modifier on the Block, i.e.
an Element can be affected by a Block-level Modifier:
```css
.l-section--offer .l-section__content-wrapper {
    background: url("../img/offer/background.png");
}
```

## CSS specificity

It is often [recommended](https://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/) to keep specificity low, consistent and very little difference between the selectors in order to make the stylesheet maintainable.
Use of BEM methodology in this project allowed to keep specificity low and avoid spikes.
The below graph, genearated by Jonas Ohlssonâ€™s [CSS Specificity Graph Generator](https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/specificity-graph/) shows specificity of this project's stylesheet.

Notes: 

## Media queries
Inspired by Dominique Briggs' [solution](https://medium.com/front-end-developers/the-solution-to-media-queries-in-sass-5493ebe16844)
!ADD DESCRIPTION


## Src File structure

The Sass architecture in this project is a modification of solution introduced in Hugo Giraudel's Sass Guidelines:

-> https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture

Components have been replaced with Blocks to keep reference to BEM methodology that has been used in this project.

BLock folder includes _block.scss partial file, which contains the Block's Elements and Modifiers, as well as a block.js file.

All the partials have been stuffed into 5 main folders: Vendor, Abstracts, Base, Blocks and Layout + an additional Shame folder including the [shame.css](https://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/) that keeps hacks, quick-fix and temporary solution awaiting for better ones.
