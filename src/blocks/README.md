# Blocks

This folder contains Blocks (components / modules / widgets ) along with their Elements and Modifiers as proposed by the BEM methodology, the component-based approach to web development
Blocks are standalone, functionally independent entities that are meaningful on their own and compose the whole site and can be reused.
